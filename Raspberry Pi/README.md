# Raspberry Pi Examples

The Raspberry Pi examples come with Wiring diagrams and feature the Analog Digital Converter IC [MCP3008](https://cdn-shop.adafruit.com/datasheets/MCP3008.pdf) by Adafruit. It is an 8 channel analog input device (like the analog pins on Arduino) that lets you use analog input components like force sensitive resistors and sliders.


Example programs:
* Blink LED
* Using the Analog Digital Converter (MCP3008 IC) with the Pi
* Blink an LED with button
* Potentiometer LED dimmer, also works with (see diagrams for examples):
  * Force senstive resistor
  * Photo Resistor
* Servo
* Arduino-like template for Pi
